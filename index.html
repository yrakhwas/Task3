        <h5>Linear Equations</h5>

        <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form

            <mark>ax + b = 0</mark>

            where <span class="var">a</span> and <span class="var">b</span> are real numbers and <span
                class="var">x</span>
            is a variable. This form is
            sometimes called the standard form of a linear
            equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not
            be
            an <span class="var">x</span>
            so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <span class="var">x</span> there.
        </p>

        <h5>Quadratic Equation</h5>

        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:

            <mark>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</mark>

            where <span class="var">a</span>, <span class="var">b</span>, <span class="var">c</span> are known values
            and
            <span class="var">x</span> is the variable or
            unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="var">a</span> can't be 0.
        </p>

        <h5>The area of a circle (A)</h5>

        <p><span class="var">&prod;</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="var">r</span>) squared:

            <mark>A = &prod; &#215; r<sup>2</sup> </mark>

            or, when you know the diameter (<span class="var">D</span>):
            <mark>A = (&prod; / 4) &#215; D<sup>2</sup> </mark>

            or, when you know the circumference (<span class="var">C</span>):
            <mark>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &#215; &prod;</mark>
        </p>

        <h5>Intersection</h5>

        <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="var">A</span> and <span class="var">B</span>, denoted by A &cap; B,
            is
            the set of all objects
            that are members of both
            the
            sets A and B. In symbols,

            <mark>A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</mark>

            That is, <span class="var">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B if and only if <span
                class="var">x</span> is both an
            element of <span class="var">A</span> and an element
            of
            <span class="var">B</span>.
